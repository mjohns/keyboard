# OpenSCAD Keyboard Lib

This repo defines utilities for generating keyboard related OpenSCAD files using c++ and is heavily inspired by the
 [dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) and the
 [dactyl_manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform).
 Major thanks to Matthew Adereth and Tom Short for their work.

The souce of truth for scad.h/cc is [here](https://github.com/mjohns/scap-cpp)

Below are keyboards built using this library. They serve as good examples for how to use the library.
